Chatbots are designed to maintain context throughout a conversation, making interactions feel more natural and human-like. They can remember traveler preferences, past interactions, and booking details, creating a seamless and personalized experience.

**7. Data-Driven Recommendations**

AI analyzes vast amounts of data to identify travel trends, popular destinations, and emerging hotspots. This data-driven approach allows chatbots to offer recommendations based on the latest trends and traveler behavior.
