By integrating AI and chatbots into the travel itinerary planning process, travel agencies and companies can provide a seamless experience for their customers. Users can interact with the system through natural language queries and receive personalized recommendations, all within a single interface. This creates a more intuitive and streamlined travel planning experience.

Learning Capabilities

AI systems have learning capabilities that allow them to adapt to user preferences over time. By analyzing user interactions and feedback, the system can improve its recommendations and provide an even more personalized travel planning experience.

Conclusion
