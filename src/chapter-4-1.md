AI and chatbots are used in travel itinerary planning to provide personalized recommendations and create optimized itineraries based on user preferences and behavior patterns. By analyzing vast amounts of data, such as flight schedules and hotel availability, AI systems can create customized travel plans that meet the user's requirements.

Chatbots can also improve accessibility for travelers by providing 24/7 access to travel information and allowing users to make changes to their itinerary at any time, from anywhere.

Additionally, AI systems have learning capabilities that allow them to adapt to user preferences over time and provide an even more personalized travel planning experience.
